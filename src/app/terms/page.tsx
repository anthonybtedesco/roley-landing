        <p>
          When we say “Company”, "Roley", “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document,
          we are referring to Role Me Inc. d/b/a Roley.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When we say “Customer”, “You” or “your”, we are referring to the
          people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our
          Services.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to
          the latest Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and
          future products and all features that we add to our Services over
          time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right
          or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving
          that right or provision. These terms do contain a limitation of our
          liability.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's
          a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us.
          We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about who we are,
          how we work, and keeping an open door to your feedback.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We may update these Terms of Service in the future. If we make any
          significant changes, we'll email our users.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Account Terms</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
            password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
            damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other
            automated methods are not permitted.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
          Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really
            free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for
            customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will charge
            your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of
            upgrade.
          </li>
          <li>
            All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by
            taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on
            behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing
            authorities. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all
            taxes, levies, or duties.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not offer any automatic refunds, but please contact us at
            team@roley.me if you're ever unhappy with our products or service.
            We're very reasonable!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
          Cancellation and Termination
        </h2>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for properly canceling paid plans.
          Cancelling your plan is easy to do from your settings. An email or
          phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered
          cancellation. If you need help cancelling your account, you can always
          contact us at team@roley.me.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any
          and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any
          time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will
          not be able to access the account or any content in the account.
          Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or
          your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of
          all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the
          use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse
          or retribution) of Company employee or officer will result in
          immediate account termination.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
          Modifications to the Service and Prices
        </h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do
          that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes.
          However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If
          we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via
          the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes
          on our websites or the affected Services themselves.
        </p>{" "}
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
          Uptime, Security, and Privacy
        </h2>
        <p>
          Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these
          Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer
          service-level agreements for most of our Services.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet.
          There are some edge cases where we may send your data through our
          network unencrypted.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that
          trust to heart. You agree that we may process your data as described
          in our Privacy Policy and for no other purpose. We as humans can
          access your data for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>
          To help you with support requests you make. We'll ask for express
          consent before accessing your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated
          process partway through. We get automated alerts when such errors
          occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing
          without looking at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to
          look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these
          rare cases, we aim to fix the root cause as much as possible to avoid
          the errors from reoccurring.
        </li>
        <li>
          To safeguard Roley.me. We'll look at logs and metadata as part of our
          work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole.
          If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an abuse report
          investigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          To the extent required by applicable law. As a US company with all
          data infrastructure located in the US, we only preserve or share
          customer data if compelled by a US government authority with a legally
          binding order or proper request under the Stored Communications Act.
          If a non-US authority approaches us for assistance, our default stance
          is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US government,
          which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an
          established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If
          we are audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum
          billing information needed to complete the audit.
        </li>
        <li>
          We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the
          necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related
          technology required to run the Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Roley.me is a
          “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with respect to
          your use of the Services. That means we process any data you share
          with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described in
          these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We do not retain, use,
          disclose, or sell any of that information for any other commercial
          purposes unless we have your explicit permission. And on the
          flip-side, you agree to comply with your requirements under the CCPA
          and not use our Services in a way that violates the regulations.

          You must not modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Features and Bugs</h2>
        <p>
          We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the
          experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However,
          there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no
          guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or
          expectations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As
          with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track
          the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any
          related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed
          and we don't guarantee completely error-free Services.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
          Services Adaptations and API Terms
        </h2>
        <p>
          We offer Application Program Interfaces ("API"s) for some of our
          Services. Any use of the API, including through a third-party product
          that accesses the Services, is bound by the terms of this agreement
          plus the following specific terms:
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>
          You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any
          damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party
          products that access data via the API.
        </li>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Liability</h2>
        <p>
          We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one
          section:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be
          liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any
          direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential,
          punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages
          for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses
          (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such
          damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the
          Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and
          services resulting from any goods, data, information or services
          purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered
          into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or
          alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct
          of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to
          this Terms of Service or the Services, whether as a breach of
          contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or
          any other theory of liability.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making
          a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that's on you, not us. We
          do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful
          management of the business; investments in security, infrastructure,
          and talent; and in general giving a damn. If you choose to use our
          Services, thank you for betting on us.
